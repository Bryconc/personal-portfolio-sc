  summary: `<p>
  During the Summer 2016, I got an opportunity to work on a maintance team at my
  apartment complex. The Univeristy Highlands in Boone, NC. This was a unique
  experience for me, as I had never had such a physically intensive workload. I
  was also branching into a new terriority of skillset, which I had no
  experience in before. Our goal was to turn over all of the apartment's 200
  units before the summer's end.
</p>

<h3>Daily Tasks</h3>

<p>
  The day to day work included renovating apartments. We would enter each unit,
  examine all the components for damage and replace appliances and furniture.
  Aside from obvious manual labor, the job provided experience in plumbing,
  electrical, and painting.
</p>

<h3>Team Breakdown</h3>

<p>
  The maintance team consisted of two supervisors and five student employees. We
  would break up into groups of two and each take a subset of units to renovate
  for the day. These teams would very from day to day.
</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

<p>
  While the job probably wouldn't provide any experience for a technical career,
  it was still a valuable experience for me. It taught me some important life
  lessons, especially in home ownership and being skilled in general handy work.
  It taught me the value of a hard day's work and the joy of working with my
  hands.
