  summary: `<p>
  Throughout my time at Appalachian State University, I was fortunate to have
  employment in the Computer Science department. While employed here, I worked
  as Instructional Assistant for Software Engineering and Client Side Web
  Development courses.
</p>

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
  As Instructional Assistant I provided the professor with assistance in
  reviewing student submitted material and working directly with students. I had
  to balance this work with my personal coursework and ensure to provide quality
  assistance, especially for peers.
</p>

<h3>Software Engineering</h3>

<p>
  This course focused primarily on Software Design patterns. These patterns came
  from the well-known textbook
  <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>. I was
  Instructional Assistant for this course for 5 semesters. Over the course of
  this position, I became intimately familar with these design patterns, and as
  a result I am always looking to implement them in my work at any scale.
</p>

<p>
  For this course I created all the answer keys for the Instructor's material,
  excluding exams.
