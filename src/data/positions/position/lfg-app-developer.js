  summary: `<p>
  I began working at Lincoln Financial Group in July of 2017, this was my first
  job after graduating from Appalachian State in May 2017. This required a
  relocation from my home state of North Carolina to Philadelphia,
  Pennslyvannia. This was one of major driving factors for selecting the job.
  This was a great way to branch out and see more of the world.

<h3>Finding Lincoln</h3>

<p>
  My discovery of Lincoln Financial Group was fairly unexpected. My friend asked
  me to attend a hackathon with him in October 2016. I was unaware at the time
  but this event, codeLinc 3, was turning out to be a 24 hr interview. I met
  some amazing new people and the culture of the event and company inspired me
  to pursue an interview in Philadelphia with them a few weeks later.

<h3>Starting Out</h3>

<p>
  When I began the job, I had only my foundational Computer Science skills from
  school. Quickly I began immersing myself in the company's tech stack and
  learning the technologies of Angular 4 and Spring MVC.
</p>

<p>
  I applied my learnings toward my early projects. The first of these was a
  Underwriting Calculator application. On this project I was the sole developer
  on the team and delivered the application on time and with great reviews. I
  then went on to work in the mobile space where I developed a Siri integration
  for our Consumer Mobile Application. While working on the mobile team I
  focused primarily on IOS and Swift development. I then went to work on a
  project for our info security team where I integrated a vendor product
  ThreatMetrix into our security stack.
</p>

<h3>Chatbot Team</h3>

<p>
  After a couple of solo projects, I was given the oppportunity to join an Agile
  team. Here I began to learn the principles and methodologies of I joined the
  team as we began to build out the public chatbot application. After I joined
  the team, I led the migration from their legacy tech stack to the enterprise
  standards of Angular 6 and Spring REST services. While I was on the team, we
  delivered both a public and secure chatbot application.

<h3>AWS Pilot Project</h3>

<p>
  I was given the oppportunity in January 2019 to help drive the cloud migration
  efforts for the enterprise. LFG was heavily on-premise and reluctant to move
  to the cloud. I was assigned one of 3 pilot projects to investigate and learn
  AWS technologies and deploy a set of our backend services. For my pilot, I
  chose to focus on serverless deployment. I studied and learned much about AWS
  Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, CloudFormation, and the Serverless Framework. I
  also helped the other pilot teams to design and deliver a container based
  deployment in AWS ECS. Here I got the oppportunity to explore and drive a
  DevOps culture for the company.
</p>

<h3>Voicebot Team</h3>

<p>
  After the chatbot team disbanded, I became technical lead for a team working
  on expanding one of our voicebot applications. This first required the
  resolution of some of our technical debt by again migrating from legacy tech
  stack to enterprise standards of Spring REST microservices.
