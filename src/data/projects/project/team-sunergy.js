    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Team Sunergy is a student-driven solar vehicle racing team. With around 30
      student members, focused in the areas of mechanical engineering,
      electrical engineering, and business strategists, the team aims to design
      and develop modern solar vehicles, viable for the consumer market. Above
      all, we highly emphasize awareness of sustainable technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before I joined the team, the team had recently competed in both the
      Formula Sun Grand Prix and the American Solar Challenge, placing

      , respectively. The team competed with the car's first iteration,
      Apperion, and in Fall 2016 they planned to begin construction on a new
      design, currently unnamed.

    <h3>Beautification/Rebuild</h3>
    <p>
      After joining the team, the first few months were a crash-course (not
      literally, thankfully) on learning the mechanics of Apperion. The best way
      develop a deep understanding was a complete rebuild from top to bottom;
      the car was in dire condition, having only recently returned from the
      summer's race, so each component needed to be disassembled, buffed,
      polished, and reinstalled. Though my initial concentration when joining
      the team was to focus on electrical components, I was fortunate enough to
      participate in this rebuilding task and familiarize myself with many
      mechanical responsibilities.

        After the summer's race, the car needed to be rebuilt and cleaned up.
        This allowed new members to become familiar with the car, as well as
        build new relationships with one another. This is a photo of me working
        on sanding the fiberglass body of the Apperion.

    <h3>Telemetry Enginner</h3>
    <p>
      Once the dust had settled on the beautification process (literally), the
      team allowed individuals to specialize in different areas for development
      on the car. Given my computer science background, I was highly inclined to
      work on the car's non-functioning telemetry system. Apparently, I was
      informed that the telemetry system, which was thought to be working, broke
      on the day of the first summer's race. I would essentially start from the
      ground up to repair the telemetry in Apperion, as we prepared to transfer
      components over to the newly designed car. Apperion would also act as a
      test environment for newly designed electrical components.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before digging into the project on my own, I sat down with Project
      Director Dan Blakeley, who explained to me the skeleton of code left
      behind by the first telemetry system. The telemetry would be based on CAN
      communication, through sensors provided by the battery protection system
      (BPS) and motor controller. We would be using the Arduino microcontroller,
      which relied on programming in C and C++.
